# Agent Task Manager Development Rules

## API Development Guidelines

### Route Management
- When creating new routes or modifying existing routes, ALWAYS update the `/info` route handler in `handlers/info.go` to reflect the changes
- The info route serves as the API documentation and must stay synchronized with actual endpoints
- Include proper request/response examples and error codes in the info route documentation

### Code Structure
- Follow existing patterns for handler organization (separate files per functionality in `handlers/tasks/`)
- Use appropriate middleware for JWT authentication on protected routes
- Maintain consistent error response format across all endpoints

### Database Operations
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records
- Apply proper indexes for performance-critical queries
- Follow GORM conventions for model definitions

### Documentation
- Keep README.md updated with any architectural changes
- Document complex business logic inline with clear comments
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md when adding new components
